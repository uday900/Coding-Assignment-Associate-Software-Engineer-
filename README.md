# Cloudvandana Associate Software Engineer Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the Associate Software Engineer coding assignment provided by Cloudvandana. The assignment consists of five tasks designed to test skills in HTML/CSS, Java, and JavaScript/DOM manipulation. Below is an overview of the project, the folder structure, and instructions to run the code.

## Assignment Overview

1. **Simple Profile Card**  
   - A responsive profile card built with HTML and CSS, featuring a profile picture, name, designation, bio, social media icons, and a hover animation effect.

2. **String Manipulation - Anagram Check**  
   - A Java program to check if two input strings are anagrams.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming - Employee Management System**  
   - A Java program with an `Employee` class, storing employee details in a list and displaying them.

4. **Simple To-Do List**  
   - A JavaScript-based to-do list with add and remove functionality, interacting with the DOM.

5. **DOM Manipulation - Image Slider**  
   - A JavaScript image slider with next/previous navigation, displaying images from an array of URLs.

## How to Run

### 1. Profile Card
- Navigate to `Profile Card/`.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the responsive profile card.

### 2. Anagram Check
- Compile and run the Java program in the root directory:
  ```bash
  javac AnagramCheck.java
  java AnagramCheck
  ```
- Alternatively, you can use an online Java compiler (e.g., JDoodle, Repl.it) by copying the code from `AnagramCheck.java`.
- Follow the prompts to input two strings and check if they are anagrams.
- Input: "listen", "silent" → Output: true (they are anagrams)
- Input: "hello", "world" → Output: false (they are not anagrams)

### 3. Employee Management System
- Compile and run the Java program in the root directory:
  ```bash
  javac EmployeeManagementSystem.java
  java EmployeeManagementSystem
  ```

- The program will display details of 3 pre-defined employees.

### 4. To-Do List
- Open `TodoList.html` in a web browser.
- Add tasks using the input field and remove them using the delete buttons.
- **Note:** If JavaScript or CSS is in separate files, ensure they are linked correctly in `TodoList.html`.

### 5. Image Slider
- Navigate to `DOM manipulation - IMAGE Slider/`.
- Open `ImageSlider.html` in a web browser.
- Use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through the images.
